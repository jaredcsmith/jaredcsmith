## Personal Projects
* **Running Injury Risk Analytics** - **_R_** - analyzed a dataset of a National Dutch Running team for daily training and performance logs to investigate factors leading up to injury. Developed derived variables to create new metrics to evaluate performance and risk of injury. My derived variables produced a model with an accuracy of 75% in predicting injuries. My approach can be used to mitigate and prevent injuries before they happen.
* **Fencing Analytics** - **_Python_** - Developed and Built a system to track fencing practices/tournament performance - implemented use of forms and tracked results at FIE, USFA, and NCAA events. This resulted in T64 finish at the Orleans Grand Prix in 2024, and multiple medal finishes at NCAA and USFA events.
