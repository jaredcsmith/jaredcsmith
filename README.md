## Professional Projects
* **<a href= "https://www.leitnerdesigns.com/collections/accessories/products/gearpod-xl-gen-2" target = "_blank"> Leitner Lid Lifter </a>** - As a research and development engineer, I developed the Leitner Lid Lifter, a gasless strut to automate the opening/closing of the Gearpod Gen II. This product was designed in Solidworks and experienced several FDM printed protoyping stages to develop final product.
* **NLP Tool** - **_R_** - Created a Natural Language Processing (NLP) tool and database for educators to process their _Course Syllabi_. The tool provides an overview of skills and learning outcomes for courses within majors, concentrations. etc.

## Personal Projects
* **Running Injury Risk Analytics** - **_R_** - analyzed a dataset of a National Dutch Running team for daily training and performance logs to investigate factors leading up to injury. Developed derived variables to create new metrics to evaluate performance and risk of injury. My derived variables produced a model with an accuracy of 75% in predicting injuries. My approach can be used to mitigate and prevent injuries before they happen.
* **NBA Free Agent Analysis** - **_Python_** - utilized NBA salary cap data and derived performance data to identify top 4 free agents for each team to target in the offseason to improve win liklihood.
