## My Goals
To innovate the current athletic landscape and develop products and experiences that influence positive change in our world!

## About Me
My name is Jared and I am derived of all those who have impacted and played a role in my life. My love for sports, data and engineering came from my father, Jay. My father and I would bond over box scores, writing stories of our teams' successes and failures, as well as the new innovations within the automative industry. I derive my passion for life, innovation, and athletics from of him.

## Personal Projects
* **Running Injury Risk Analytics** - **_R_** - analyzed a dataset of a National Dutch Running team for daily training and performance logs to investigate factors leading up to injury. Developed derived variables to create new metrics to evaluate performance and risk of injury. My derived variables produced a model with an accuracy of 75% in predicting injuries. My approach can be used to mitigate and prevent injuries before they happen. 
* **NBA DATA**:
  * **Free Agency Analytics** - **_Python_** - Evaluated all NBA players to identify underrated players for front office's to target in free agency or in the trade market. Produced a classification model based on important statistics, including a new stat, Points Responsible.
