## Personal Projects
* **Running Injury Risk Analytics** - **_R_** - analyzed a dataset of a National Dutch Running team for daily training and performance logs to investigate factors leading up to injury. Developed derived variables to create new metrics to evaluate performance and risk of injury. My derived variables produced a model with an accuracy of 75% in predicting injuries. My approach can be used to mitigate and prevent injuries before they happen.
